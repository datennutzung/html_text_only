# ðŸ’» Only Text

This Webpage was made to look like an oldschool terminal application,
it only has text, no images, no borders, no margin or padding.
Just a lot of text in a `<pre>` block.

Please, for the love of all that is good, do not try and use this for anything.
The code is horrible and clunky, it does not work on mobile or without Javascript.  
A screenreader would probably die trying to read this and almost everyone will have problems
navigating it.
